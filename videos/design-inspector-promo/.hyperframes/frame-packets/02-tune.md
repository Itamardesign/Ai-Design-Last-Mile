## Frame 2 — Tune it live

- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/02-tune.html
- duration: 6.5s
- transition_in: cut
- scene: Inspector controls and the selected button update together in a tightly coupled edit loop.
- poster: 4.0s
- type: feature_showcase
- blueprint: panel-edit-live-sync (Reproduce)
- asset_candidates: assets/ui-source.txt — reference-only source for live DOM reconstruction
- focal: "selected hero button bound to the inspector controls"
- roles: "reconstructed HTML/DOM UI = foreground product surface"
- handoff_in: "selected button at x=520, y=604, scale=1, opacity=1, motion direction=stationary, speed=0; inspector panel at x=1450, y=80, scale=1, opacity=1, motion direction=stationary, speed=0"
- handoff_out: "selected violet button at x=520, y=604, scale=1, opacity=1, motion direction=stationary, speed=0; inspector handoff tab at x=1450, y=80, scale=1, opacity=1, motion direction=stationary, speed=0"

Keep the selected element and inspector bound in one view. The cursor scrubs radius and spacing,
chooses the violet design token, and the target updates immediately. A compact accessibility
status flips to pass. On-screen copy: “Tune it live.”

Reproduce: use the live-sync couple exactly—the same selected button and the same bound panel
change together on every edit beat; keep both visible for the whole shot.

Scene 1 (0.0–1.2s): begin on the exact handoff geometry. The selected button holds left while
the inspector's Layout group expands right; redline spacing chips pop in one after another around
the target (`spring-pop-entrance`). “Tune it live.” reveals above the page in display type.

Scene 2 (1.2–3.0s): the cursor grabs the radius field and scrubs `8 → 24`; the readout and all
four button corners update simultaneously (`control-target-sync`, `counting-dynamic-scale`). The
framing remains asymmetric 70/30 with both control and target co-visible.

Scene 3 (3.0–4.8s): the cursor scrubs horizontal padding `20 → 32`; the button stretches in the
same beat and the measurement chips update to `32` (`control-target-sync`). The panel scrolls just
enough to reveal Fill while the camera stays locked.

Scene 4 (4.8–5.8s): the violet `brand/500` swatch is selected; its checkmark lands and the target
fill snaps to the exact same token while a bound-token pill appears (`dynamic-content-sequencing`,
`scale-swap-transition`).

Scene 5 (5.8–6.5s): accessibility flips from “Checking” to a green “AA · Pass” state and the
Handoff tab becomes active. The edit couple settles and holds without drift.

# Control-Target Sync

THE live-editing move: an inspector/editor control is manipulated — a value scrubbed, a field retyped, a dropdown picked — and a **bound second element answers in the same frame**. The button rotates WHILE the rotation value scrubs; icons resize PER KEYSTROKE. The persuasion is causality — one gesture, two surfaces changing together — and this rule is the coupling contract that produces it.

Nearest precedent is [reactive-displacement.md](reactive-displacement.md): that rule also derives two elements' motion from one source, but it is **collision physics** — an entering intruder displaces an exiting victim, once, as a transition, and the victim leaves. This rule is a **live editing mirror**: the control is manipulated repeatedly across several beats, the target answers every time, and both sides hold the stage throughout. The numeric readout rides [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md)'s proxy pattern; discrete steps ride [discrete-text-sequence.md](discrete-text-sequence.md)'s threshold pattern — what this rule adds is the law that binds either of them to the target.

## How It Works

An **edit beat** is a set of concurrent tweens at ONE timeline label: `tl.addLabel("edit1", …)`, then the **readout tween** (numeric proxy + `onUpdate` writing `textContent` only) and the **target transform tween** (`rotation` / `x` / `y` / `scale` to the same endpoint), both placed at the label with the same **duration** and **ease**. The two motions are two projections of one gesture — value at 40% ⇒ target at 40%, on every frame, under any seek. That mathematical lockstep reads as "the panel is editing the page," not "two animations happen to overlap."

For **discrete edits** (per-keystroke retypes, dropdown picks, unit snaps) the couple steps instead of glides: a single threshold state array carries BOTH sides — each state holds the readout text AND the target's property value — and one driver applies whichever state is active. Both sides read from the same state object, so they cannot desync.

Chain 2–4 edit beats with short holds between, and end on a **landed** edit — the last value applied and holding, never a tooltip with the dropdown unopened.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Bipartite by construction: target surface + inspector panel share the frame.
     Every scrubbed readout gets `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` and a fixed
     min-width (≥ the longest value) or the panel edge jitters as digits change. -->
<div class="target-surface">
  <div class="target-button" id="target-button">{buttonLabel}</div>
  <div class="preview-row">
    <div class="preview-icon">{iconA}</div>
    …
  </div>
</div>
<div class="panel">
  <div class="field-row">
    <span>Rotation</span><span class="field-value" id="rotation-readout">0°</span>
  </div>
  <div class="field-row">
    <span>Class</span><span class="field-value mono" id="class-readout">text-1xl</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// ---- Continuous couple: ONE label; both tweens share duration AND ease ----
tl.addLabel("edit1", EDIT1_AT);
const rotState = { v: 0 };
const rotReadout = document.getElementById("rotation-readout");
tl.to(
  rotState,
  {
    v: ROT_TARGET,
    duration: SCRUB_DUR,
    ease: SCRUB_EASE,
    onUpdate: () => {
      rotReadout.textContent = `${Math.round(rotState.v)}°`;
    },
  },
  "edit1",
);
tl.to(
  "#target-button",
  { rotation: ROT_TARGET, duration: SCRUB_DUR, ease: SCRUB_EASE },
  "edit1", // same label — the mirror answers in the same frame
);

// ---- Discrete couple: ONE state array carries BOTH sides ----
const STEPS = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "text-1xl", scale: 1.0 }, // must equal the initial state
  { t: 0.4, text: "text-4xl", scale: 1.9 },
  { t: 1.0, text: "text-xl", scale: 0.85 }, // backspace
  { t: 1.35, text: "text-2xl", scale: 1.3 }, // lands
];
const stepAt = (time) => [...STEPS].reverse().find((s) => time >= s.t) ?? STEPS[0];

tl.addLabel("edit3", EDIT3_AT);
const classReadout = document.getElementById("class-readout");
const stepDriver = { t: 0 };
let lastStep = null;
tl.to(
  stepDriver,
  {
    t: STEPS_TOTAL,
    duration: STEPS_TOTAL,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const s = stepAt(stepDriver.t);
      if (s !== lastStep) {
        classReadout.textContent = s.text; // control steps
        gsap.set(".preview-icon", { scale: s.scale }); // target steps — same state object
        lastStep = s;
      }
    },
  },
  "edit3",
);
```

## Variations

- **Dropdown pick → instant conversion (self-conversion)** — the pick converts the panel's own readout in place (`tl.set("#padding-readout", { textContent: "6 px" }, "pick")`); control and target collapse into one element. Compose the dropdown from neighbors: menu pops via [spring-pop-entrance.md](spring-pop-entrance.md), row hover-stepping via [dynamic-content-sequencing.md](dynamic-content-sequencing.md). The conversion must be an INSTANT snap — tweening between unit strings reads as broken, and instantness is the feature being sold.
- **Easing-handle drag → target re-animates (deferred mirror)** — the edit authors a _behavior_, so the mirror is a **replay**, not a concurrent transform: beat 1 drags the handle (handle tween + coords readout), then at a later label the target performs its motion with the newly-authored curve (`tl.fromTo("#toggle-knob", { x: 0 }, { x: KNOB_TRAVEL, duration: REPLAY_DUR, ease: AUTHORED_EASE }, "replay")`), often under a zoom-out ([viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md)). The one sanctioned case where the response is not in the gesture's beat; the replay must still be unmistakably the edited parameter.
- **Read-sync mirror (reverse direction)** — the gesture happens ON the target (hovering swatches, selecting an element) and the PANEL readout is the bound side. Same discrete contract — one state array of `{ t, hoverTarget, readout }` drives both the highlight and the text.
- **Color couple** — the readout counts (`0 → 80`) while the target's `backgroundColor` tweens between two palette stops at the same label. Keep it two fixed stops (GSAP interpolates); never derive per-frame hex strings by hand.

| SCRUB_EASE           | `power1.inOut` / `power2.inOut` | shared verbatim by both tweens. Never `back.out` / `elastic.out` — an overshooting value reads as a broken hinge; the readout is data |

| HOLD_BETWEEN         | 0.3–0.8 s                       | each landed value gets a breath; below 0.3 s the beats smear into one gesture                                                         |
| BEAT_COUNT           | 2–4                             | one edit is a moment, not a demo; past 4 the shot reads as a settings tour                                                            |
| STEP gaps (discrete) | 0.15–0.5 s                      | keystroke pacing per discrete-text-sequence; first state must equal the on-load state                                                 |

## Critical Constraints

- **One label, one gesture** — readout tween and target tween share position, duration, AND ease; never sequence readout-then-target, and never stagger the target behind the readout even by 0.1 s — a delayed response reads as an animation following an edit, not a bound surface. A mismatched ease desyncs the mirror mid-tween even when endpoints agree.
- **Discrete steps share one state object** — both sides read the same array entry, so desync is impossible by construction; first entry mirrors the initial DOM state.
- **The readout is data** — no overshoot, no bounce on the settle; the target may carry the gesture's ease but lands exactly on the edited value.
- **Co-visibility is load-bearing** — control and target share the frame for every edit beat; a camera move must never crop the mirror out (punch-and-return around the beats, not through them).
- **`tabular-nums` + fixed `min-width`** on every scrubbed readout; `onUpdate` is O(1) — text writes only, discrete drivers guard writes with a last-state check.
- **End on a landed edit** — the final beat resolves with the value applied and holding (or the deferred-mirror replay); never mid-gesture or on an unopened menu.
- **The gesture's actor is a separate rule** — cursor glide, grab-cursor flip, and click feedback come from the cursor rules; this rule owns only the couple.

# Counting with Dynamic Scale

A number counts from A → B while its transform scale grows to the final size — escalating visual weight ("this is impressive") without tweening `font-size` or forcing text layout on every frame. The final font size is static CSS; only the transform changes.

## How It Works

Two synchronized tweens at the SAME timeline position with the SAME ease: (1) a proxy value rendered as text via `onUpdate` (`Math.round(...).toLocaleString()`), (2) the counter's transform `scale: START_SCALE → 1`, where `START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE`. A suffix (`%`, `×`, `+`) slides in AFTER the count lands — the number gets its own beat — and a label fades in early.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="counter-wrap">
  <span class="counter" id="counter">0</span><span class="counter-suffix">{suffix}</span>
</div>
<div class="counter-label">{label}</div>
```

```css
.counter-wrap {
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  justify-content: center;
  width: {counterContainerWidth}; /* fixed width — no layout shift as digit count changes */
}
.counter {
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; /* MANDATORY — digits keep equal width */
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: {endSize}; /* final size is static; GSAP animates scale, not font-size */
  transform-origin: center center;
}
.counter-suffix {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(20px);
}
```

```js
const counter = document.getElementById("counter");
const state = { value: 0 };
const START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE;

// Count value — onUpdate changes text only
tl.to(
  state,
  {
    value: TARGET_VALUE,
    duration: COUNT_DUR,
    ease: COUNT_EASE,
    onUpdate: () => {
      counter.textContent = Math.round(state.value).toLocaleString();
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Visual growth — compositor transform sharing the count's timing + ease
tl.fromTo(counter, { scale: START_SCALE }, { scale: 1, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE }, 0);

// Suffix slides in AFTER the count completes
tl.to(
  ".counter-suffix",
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUFFIX_DUR, ease: `back.out(${SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  COUNT_DUR,
);

// Label fades in early
tl.from(".counter-label", { opacity: 0, y: 12, duration: LABEL_DUR, ease: "power2.out" }, LABEL_AT);
```

## Variations

- **Direct `innerText` tween (no proxy)** — GSAP can tween `innerText` directly for a number-only counter; keep the proxy form when you need locale formatting or suffix logic. The scale tween stays separate either way:

```js
tl.to(
  counter,
  { innerText: TARGET_VALUE, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE, snap: { innerText: 1 } },
  0,
);
```

- **3D depth entry** — add a `tl.from(".counter", { z: -300, ... }, 0)` push-in; requires `perspective` on `.counter-wrap` and `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the counter.
- **Multi-stat coordinated reveal** — 3 stats counting in parallel share the SAME ease, duration, and start position so they finish together (a chord, not an arpeggio). Each stat usually also needs a paired graphic (bar / ring / stars) — don't stop at the number; see [stat-bars-and-fills.md](stat-bars-and-fills.md).

## Values

| TARGET_VALUE          | 2–3 digits ideal                            | 4+ digits needs a wider container; must fit at END_SIZE without clipping      |
| START_SIZE / END_SIZE | START ≈ 40–60% of END                       | design inputs used once for START_SCALE; never tween either                   |
| COUNT_DUR             | 1.2–2.5s                                    | below ~0.8s reads as a flash — the eye must read the digits scrolling past    |
| COUNT_EASE            | `power2.out` / `power3.out` ⭐ / `expo.out` | shared by value + scale; more `.out` = more dramatic deceleration at the peak |
| SUFFIX_DUR            | 0.3–0.6s                                    | fires at `COUNT_DUR`, never during the count                                  |
| SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR  | 1.4–2.0                                     | overshoot is fine on the suffix (it's punctuation, not data)                  |
| LABEL_AT / LABEL_DUR  | AT < COUNT_DUR/2; 0.4–0.7s                  | label arrives before the count peaks                                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **`tabular-nums` mandatory** + fixed-width container as belt-and-suspenders — without them digit-count transitions (9 → 10 → 100) jitter as glyph widths change.
- **Never set `fontSize` in `onUpdate`** — final type size is static CSS; only the transform changes per frame. Keep `onUpdate` O(1): set text only, no style writes or DOM creation.
- **`Math.round`, not `Math.floor`** — halfway through the final integer should already display the final value.
- **Avoid `back.out` / `elastic.out` on the counter itself** — overshoot makes the number look unstable (it's data, not decoration). Grow in place, don't bounce.
- **Label is BIG TEXT, not a page-style caption** — a tiny paragraph under a hero-size number reads as visual noise in video. Display-size, uppercase, tracked: the label is part of the headline.

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.

# Spring-Pop Entrance

> **Smooth beats bouncy.** This entrance defaults to a smooth long-tail settle — `power3.out` (or `expo.out` for a faster front) — that decelerates cleanly into the resting size with **no overshoot**. Bouncy `back.out` is the **#1 instant turn-off** in agent-made videos and is almost never executed well; it is a rare, explicitly-playful exception (consumer / fun brand), never the default. When unsure, settle smoothly.

THE entrance primitive: an element (or staggered group) arrives by springing from nothing — `scale: 0 → 1`, optional small `y` rise — and settles without bouncing. This is **arrival**, not reaction: distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (a click/press → release feedback chain on an element that already rests on screen). Many blueprints used to borrow that rule to fake an entrance; reach for this instead.

## How It Works

One `fromTo` carries the whole arrival: from `{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }` (explicit, so t=0 is correct under seek) to `{ scale: 1, opacity: 1, ease: "power3.out" }`. For a **group**, the same `fromTo` runs per element at `i * STAGGER`, capped so the group reads as one arriving beat. The `scale` grow is load-bearing; the `y` rise is garnish — drop everything else and it must still read as a clean entrance. Let the ease produce the settle: never hand-key a `scale: 1.1` mid-state (it double-bounces against the curve).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="pop-hero" id="hero">{heroLabel}</div>

<div class="pop-grid">
  <div class="pop-item">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.pop-hero,
.pop-item {
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* in-place pop; move to the source point for the anchored variation */
  will-change: transform;
}
.pop-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: GRID_GAP;
  place-items: center;
}
```

```js
// Single hero pop — smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot.
tl.fromTo(
  "#hero",
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  ENTRY_AT,
);

// Staggered group pop — one arriving beat.
gsap.utils.toArray(".pop-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { scale: 0, opacity: 0, y: Y_RISE },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
    GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Calm settle** (premium / enterprise): `power3.out`, no rotation, `Y_RISE` 0–12px — a weighted, confident landing for a hero wordmark or product shot.
- **Firm settle** (everyday default): `power3.out` or `expo.out` for a punchier front, `Y_RISE` ~24px — cards, icons, callouts.
- **Exact-physics settle**: when the settle IS the shot, swap the ease for `springEase({ response: 0.4 })` (critically damped) from `../adapters/gsap-easing-and-stagger.md` → Spring Eases; take `duration` from the helper.
- **Origin-anchored pop**: a callout growing out of a specific point (marker, pointer tip) sets `transform-origin` to that point (e.g. `0% 100%`) so `scale: 0 → 1` reads as "emerging from the source", not "inflating in place".
- **Pop into a held slot**: land the pop and hold still — no idle loop baked into the entrance. If the held frame genuinely needs life, hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for subtle jitter on a separate later tween; prefer revealing the next element on its VO cue.
- **Bouncy pop (RARE — explicitly-playful only)**: swap the ease for `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` and optionally settle a small `rotation: ROT_FROM → 0` so elements look hand-placed. Only for a deliberately playful register — never product / enterprise / serious tone:

```js
tl.fromTo(
  el,
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0, rotation: ROT_FROM },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, rotation: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: `back.out(${OVERSHOOT})` },
  GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
);
```

Even here keep `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2` — past that it reads as cartoon wobble. Better still: the baked spring at `dampingFraction: 0.6–0.7` (same adapters doc) gives ~5–10% overshoot that reads physical where `back.out` reads cartoon.

| ROT_FROM   | −10°–+10°                                 | playful variant only; alternate sign by index (`i % 2 ? 6 : -6`) |
| ENTRY_AT   | 0–0.4s                                    | a beat of quiet, but keep the subject landing by t ≤ 0.5s        |

## Critical Constraints

- Default ease `power3.out` (no overshoot); `back.out` only in the explicitly-playful variant, and there `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2`.
- `ITEM_COUNT × STAGGER ≤ ~0.5s` — the group must land inside one beat.
- Entrances state the collapsed from-state in `fromTo` — never rely on a CSS-hidden start (it renders visible before the tween claims it under seek).
- `transform-origin: 50% 50%` for an in-place pop; the source point only for the anchored variation.
- This is a finite arrival — idle motion on a held element is a separate, later `sine-wave-loop` tween.
